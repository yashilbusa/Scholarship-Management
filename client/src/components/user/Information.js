                <li>
                  <i className="ri-arrow-right-line" />
                  Eligibility requirements may include maintaining a certain
                  GPA, demonstrating financial need, or being enrolled in a
                  particular course of study.

                  It is important for applicants to carefully review the
                  eligibility criteria for each scholarship opportunity they are
                  interested in.
                </li>

                  Applicants should ensure that they meet all of the necessary
                  requirements before applying.

                  Meeting the eligibility criteria is a necessary first step in
                  the application process.

                  However, meeting the eligibility criteria does not guarantee
                  that an applicant will receive a scholarship.
